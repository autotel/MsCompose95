  "body": "### Ms Compose 95\r\nI could say that this is an interaction experiment. Truth is that is just a whim. This is a web audio api based experiment, where the user is presented with an array of sequencers. The size of the sequencing buttons is just between being a pixel and a sequencer button. The user can draw around, which will result in sequences.\r\nEach color represents an audio file, which is repeated along many sequencers, this is because each sequencer has it's own timbre, running speed and length. All the speeds and length are powers of two, because the intention is making loops, and 4/4 measure is the easiest to understand.\r\n+A good way of getting started is opening the window, and just dragging the cursor once. \r\n+So far only works in chrome. I don't yet understand why not in firefox; any help here is greatly appreciated.\r\n+It relies heavily on the Jquery, Tone js and nexus ui libraries.\r\n",

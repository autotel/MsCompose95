# MsCompose95, mini version

mini version, meaning that all the resources and code gets bundled into a single file. It leaves behind most libraries used in the main version, and the websockets.

I could say that this is an interaction experiment, but truth is that is just a whim. This is a web audio api based experiment, where the user is presented with an array of sequencers. The size of the sequencing buttons is just between being a pixel and a sequencer button. The user can draw around, which will result in sequences. Each color represents an audio file, which is repeated along many sequencers, this is because each sequencer has itâ€™s own timbre, running speed and length. All the speeds and length are powers of two, because the intention is making loops, and 4/4 measure is the easiest to understand.
